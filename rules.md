Rules: 

This Journal is mainly for keeping a record of various bits of knowledge accumulated in my quest of becoming a true developer. 
Feel free to to drop in any suggestions and feel free to correct my understanding. 

The plan is to make siginificant entries when I feel like, for starters I'll try to make atleast one entry per week

Should Stick to the following:

1. Each entry **should** have the following as a precursor

* Log: DD-YY-MM
* Topic: The subject addressed by the entry
* Tag: To what field does the entry belongs to.

2. When To make an Entry. 

Anything worth noting down from: 

* Forums that I come across.
* Any interesting subject being addressed at work
* Books, PDFs, discussion etc. 

3. Why Public ? 

* To promote open dialogue and challenge my understanding.
